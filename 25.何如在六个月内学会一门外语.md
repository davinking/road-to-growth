##25.何如在六个月内学会一门外语

语言学家Chris Lonsdale总结出了**5个原则、7个行动**。他相信只要遵从这5个原则、践行这7个行动，任何人都能在6个月内学会一种外语。

###The five principles are:

1. Focus on language content that is relevant to you.

2. Use your language as a tool to communicate from day 1.

3. When you understand the message you will acquire the language unconsciously.

4. Language is not about accumulating a lot of knowledge but is rather a type of physiological training.

5. Psycho-physiological state matters – you need to be happy, relaxed, and most importantly, you need to be tolerant of ambiguity. Don’t try to understand every detail as it will drive you crazy.



###The seven actions are:

1. Listen a lot – it doesn’t matter if you understand or not. Listen to rhythms andpatterns.

2. Focus on getting the meaning first, before the words. Body language and facial expressions can help.

3. Start mixing, get creative, and use what you’re learning

4. Focus on the core – use the most commonly-use the words, and use the language to learn more

5. Get a language parent – someone who is fluent in the language and who will do their best to understand what you mean; who will not correct your mistakes; who will feedback their understanding of what you’re saying using correct language, and uses words that you know.

6. Copy the face – watch native speakers and observe their face, and particular their mouth moves when they’re speaking.

7. “Direct connect” to the target language – find ways to connect words directly with images and other internal representations.
